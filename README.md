## Project Origin and Development Process

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), utilizing the Next.js framework. It represents an exciting experiment in AI-assisted development, where the majority of the code was generated through AI prompts and suggestions.

The development process involved:

1. Providing initial prompts and requirements to the AI
2. Reviewing and accepting AI-generated code with minimal manual changes
3. Iterating through prompts to refine and expand functionality
4. Addressing errors and making adjustments through further AI assistance

This approach resulted in a remarkably efficient development cycle, with most of the coding done by AI while human input focused on direction, error resolution, and fine-tuning. The experiment demonstrated the potential of AI to significantly accelerate web development workflows, especially for rapid prototyping and initial implementation phases.

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
